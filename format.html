    <del>The success of Ye Maaya Chesave (2010) and subsequent back-to-back successes prompted Rediff.com to label her "the most sought-after actress in the Telugu film industry" in 2014.[153] Her initial choice of films depicted her as an actress who actively selects to feature in strong female roles, with The Times of India noting that "scripts are written around the characters she portrays" and that she held a place in the "wishlist of every top actor, director and producer".[154] Her inclusion in Telugu film projects were also initially considered a "lucky charm" by producers, though Samantha acknowledged that though "destiny" played a role in her career, and that there were "many women out there who are more beautiful and more talented" than she was and that she hoped her name would instead be "synonymous with hard work".[154] Samantha also stated that she was willing to forgo her salary demands to appear in good films, revealing that she worked on Gautham Vasudev Menon's films for lower fees and that she had rejected more lucrative offers to feature in S. S. Rajamouli's Eega</del><br><br>

    After portraying strong characters in her initial films, Samantha featured in increasingly hero-centric films in the mid-2010s<sub>When questioned on her decision not to take up more heroine-oriented roles, Samantha lamented the lack of chances that the South Indian film industry presents for established female characters and described it as "simply male-dominated"</sub><br><br>
    Talking about her glamorous role in her comeback Tamil film, Anjaan (2014), Samantha stated that she made a "thoughtful call" as "it was important to do these kind of films to get exposure into the market," and that regrettably "mass films" were "where the main audience" was in South Indian cinema<sup>She also added that she did not want to be "typecast as the girl-next-door" and was keen to prove critics wrong, who said that she could not fit into glamorous roles.[156] In an interview in 2015, Samantha suggested that she was unhappy with her work during the previous year and would no longer do any more films where she would be "required to do five songs and the scenes leading up to the songs" and made a promise to herself that "if she were not going to get good roles," she would quit acting.</sup>
